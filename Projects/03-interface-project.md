## PROJECT 3: TIME INTERFACE
Using InDesign, you will design wireframes for a digital screen interface to display some aspect of time. This could be a clock, a time-keeper, a stopwatch, something that keeps track of cyclical time, but can be any representation of time, presented on the subway platform waiting screens.

#### Preliminary Research
Put together an Are.na channel of visual references that relate to both the *visual and technical* components of your time interface

#### INTERFACE 1st Draft: Wireframes    
Post to the #exercise-interface Slack channel in grayscale (includes black and white). 

* Create a wireframe of your interface in mobile device dimensions. 
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Use Lorem Ipsum for placeholder text at this stage.

#### INTERFACE 2nd Draft: High-Fidelity Wireframes  
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity wireframes in color
* Post to the #exercise-interface Slack channel

#### INTERFACE Final: Final Hi-Fidelity Prototype 
* Refine design based on feedback from your classmates and the professor as discussed in group critiques and one-on-one desk crits.
