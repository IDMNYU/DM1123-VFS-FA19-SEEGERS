## **Future Bio**

Submit via email it to me **as a PDF,** and make sure to **name the file properly like so: lastname, firstname_future bio.pdf**

- Write a 200-500 word bio imagining your professional and personal accomplishments 30 years from now. Some questions to think about and include in your description:
  - The kinds of work you will have completed
  - Collaborations with other people/companies
  - Do you have a specialty?
  - Have you won any awards or recognitions? If so, which ones?
  - Who are your clients?
  - Have you had exhibitions of your work?
  - Has your work been published anywhere, in magazines, blogs, etc.?

- Here are some reference examples to get you thinking:

  - 2x4: Michael Rock, Susan Sellers, Georgianna Stout: http://2x4.org/people/

  - Milton Glaser (note the short, intermediate and long versions): http://www.miltonglaser.com/milton/#0
