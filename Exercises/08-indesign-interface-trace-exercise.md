## InDesign Interface Trace Exercise

This exercise is about PROCESS - the purpose is to become more familiar with InDesign by learning possible workflows, tools, and concepts, in such a way that they can be used and applied in the future in other software. NOTE: This exercise is NOT about the final design - the final design is already done, we are reverse-engineering someone else's final design in order to learn about composition and hierarchy.

- Choose an app interface on your phone, take screenshots of 3 different screens (the screens should be very substantively different, but clearly from the same app with at least 3 different types of pages, probably do not choose the app settings page?)
  - be creative with what interface you take screenshots of
- Create a new InDesign document with 3 non-facing pages, using the InDesign preset of your phone manufacturer (iPhone/Samsing/Google/etc.)
- Create a background layer and an art layer, label them accordingly, place your 3 chosen screenshots on the background layer each page, lock the backgroud layer
- Re-create a copy of every element in the interface design in InDesign: all buttons, text, typography, graphics, etc.
- Use Illustrator to make icons and place them in InDesign
- Replace specific content with placeholder content (lorem ipsum text, image placeholders)
- Match all stylistic formatting (text family, size, hierarchy, and colors)

#### Some concepts to explore in this exercise:

- creating , or in this case reverse-engineering, grids and guides (Layout->Create Guides)
- duplicating recurring elements (copy->paste in place)
- layers (layers panel)
- master page elements
- Placing UI elements from Illustrator, managing & updating links
- Effects & Object Styles
- Placeholder text and images (fill with placeholder text, lorem ipsum)
- eyedropper tool
- exporting to PDF (file->export)
- Packaging and Zipping folder to send to collaborators
