### Class Exercise: Image Trace

**Post to the #exercise-image-trace**

Choose a crop from Hieronymous Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights, found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg

- Use Illustrator to create a vector artwork interpretation using ONLY strokes
- Use the auto-trace function in Illustrator to create a vector version of the image using strokes AND fills
- Use Illustrator to create a vector artwork interpretation using strokes and fills as you feel appropriate

Save those 3 separate images as 3 pages of a multi-page PDF, via a multi-artboard Illustrator file
